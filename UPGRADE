		    Notes for Upgrade Installation

======================================================================
<< Generic Hints >>

* Use `ebnugrade' to upgrade a configuration file.

Use the `ebnupgrade' command if you want to upgrade a configuration
file (ebnetd.conf or ndtpd.conf) with ease.  `ebnupgrade' reads a
configuration file for earlier version of EBNETD, NDTPD or ebHTTPD,
then generates a new one which is suitable for this version of EBNETD.

`ebnupgrade' reads the default EBNETD configuration file, and outputs
new configuration to the file `<default-configuration-file>.new'.  You
can replace your configuration file by the sequence of commands.

	/usr/local/sbin/ebnupgrade
	mv /usr/local/etc/ebnetd.conf /usr/local/etc/ebnetd.conf.orig
	mv /usr/local/etc/ebnetd.conf.new /usr/local/etc/ebnetd.conf

It supposes that EBNETD has been installed under `/usr/local' and if 
directories for system administrative executables (`sbindir') and for
read-only single-machine data ('sysconfdir') have not been changed at
the installation.

`ebnupgrade' also reports how does it modify a configuration file.
The reports are output to standard error.

	ebnetd.conf: 8: server-name' is obsoleted (comment out)
	ebnetd.conf: 38: ident-hosts' is obsoleted (comment out)
	ebnetd.conf: 42: ident-timeout' is obsoleted (comment out)
	ebnetd.conf: 89: netmask in `hosts' must be an integer. (fixed)

Try `ebnupgrade --help' for information about command line options.
